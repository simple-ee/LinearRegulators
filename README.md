# Linear Regulators
These are designs of different linear regulators ranging from high input voltage to low input voltage regulators.

MCP1792T:
1. This folder contains the designs for a high input voltage regulator.  There are two varients, a 3.3V and a 5V version and this design can accomadate both parts you just need to by the correct one.
2. Specs: Max input voltage is 55V with transcients up to 70V, Max output current is 100mA
