# Linear Regulators
These are designs of different linear regulators ranging from high input voltage to low input voltage regulators.
1. MCP1792T:
    -- This folder contains the designs for a high input voltage regulator.  There are two varients, a 3.3V and a 5V version and this design can accomadate both parts you just need       
       to by the correct one.
    -- Specs: Max input voltage is 55V with transcients up to 70V
              Max output current is 100mA
